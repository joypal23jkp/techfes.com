      <span>Date</span>
      <p>The class selector starts with a dot (.) character. It will select everything in the document with that class applied to it. In the live example below we have created a class called highlight, and have applied it to several places in my document. All of the elements that have the class applied are highlighted.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="first">Hello</li>
        <li class="first second">Hello</li>
        <li class="first-second">Hello</li>
        <li class="trd-first">Hello</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>
          <p>Paragraph</p>
